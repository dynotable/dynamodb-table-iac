# dynamodb-table-iac: Terraform for DynamoDB table "iacfx-c-stream"
# Source: aws dynamodb describe-table + describe-time-to-live, region us-east-1
#
# Not emitted (configure these yourself if the live table uses them):
#   - point-in-time recovery (DescribeTable does not return it; a replica declared without it has PITR off)
#   - tags (DescribeTable does not return them; applying removes live tags)
#   - auto-scaling policies (a fixed capacity snapshot is emitted instead; applying replaces the policy with that snapshot)
#   - warm throughput (DescribeTable reports the CURRENT value, which grows with traffic; emitting it would bill a pre-warm)
#   - contributor insights, Kinesis streaming destinations and resource policies (DescribeTable does not return them)
#   - the KMS key ARN of an SSE-encrypted table (DescribeTable cannot tell an AWS-managed key from a customer-managed one; the AWS-managed key is emitted and the live ARN is left in a comment)
#   - settings of non-home replicas that DynamoDB never synchronizes (their deletion protection, PITR and tags are only visible from their own region)
#
# To adopt the live table instead of creating a new one, uncomment this import
# block, then run `terraform plan` and check that it reports no changes:
# import {
#   to = aws_dynamodb_table.iacfx_c_stream
#   id = "iacfx-c-stream"
# }
